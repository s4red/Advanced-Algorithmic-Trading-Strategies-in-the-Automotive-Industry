## Advanced-Algorithmic-Trading-Strategies-in-the-Automotive-Industry

#### Introduction/Description
This project explores the development, optimization, and backtesting of advanced algorithmic trading strategies for two automotive industry stocks: Honda (HMC) and Toyota (TM). Utilizing Bayesian optimization and machine learning techniques, this analysis aims to predict stock price movements and integrate these predictions into a profitable trading strategy. The objective is to outperform traditional buy-and-hold strategies by leveraging data-driven approaches to maximize returns and manage risks.

#### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BayesianOptimization

#### Installation
Follow these steps to get your development environment running:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

#### Usage
To run this project, follow these steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook Algorithmic_Trading_individual_sk.ipynb
```
Inside the notebook, execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis from data loading through to model evaluation.

#### Methodology
The methodology for this project is designed to develop and evaluate algorithmic trading strategies for automotive stocks. The steps include:
- **Data Collection:** Historical stock price data for Honda and Toyota from January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2024, along with S&P 500 index data for benchmarking.
- **Technical Indicator Strategy:** Utilizing Bayesian Optimization to fine-tune parameters for Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) and Relative Strength Index (RSI). Buy signals are generated when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA with RSI below 70, and sell signals occur when the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA with RSI above 30.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implementing machine learning models to predict both the direction and magnitude of stock price movements. The models include various algorithms tested for accuracy and performance.
- **Backtesting:** Simulating the trading strategy on historical data to evaluate potential profitability and risk management effectiveness.

#### Analysis Overview
The analysis pipeline includes:
- **Data Exploration:** Understanding feature distributions, identifying trends, and visualizing price movements.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features for model training.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that capture relevant market signals and patterns.
- **Model Selection:** Comparing various machine learning algorithms to find the best performer for our specific dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Sharpe ratio, and drawdown to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Backtesting:** Testing the strategy on historical data to evaluate its potential profitability and risk management effectiveness.

#### Key Insights and Findings
- **Total Return:** The optimized strategy achieved a total return of 505.81%, indicating substantial growth.
- **Sharpe Ratio:** A Sharpe ratio of 0.84 suggests that the strategy achieved a favorable risk-adjusted return.
- **CAGR:** The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.08% indicates significant annual growth.
- **Drawdown:** The maximum drawdown of -54.08% reflects considerable risk, underscoring the importance of managing downside risk.
- **Machine Learning Accuracy:** The model's accuracy for predicting stock movements was around 50%, indicating a need for further refinement.
- **Performance Comparison:** The machine learning-based strategy underperformed compared to the traditional Buy & Hold strategy, highlighting areas for improvement in predictive accuracy and risk management.

#### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential and challenges of applying machine learning and Bayesian optimization in developing algorithmic trading strategies for automotive industry stocks. Despite the sophisticated approach, the ML-based strategy underperformed compared to the Buy & Hold strategy, emphasizing the need for continuous optimization and risk management. Future work could involve refining the machine learning models, incorporating additional features, and exploring more advanced techniques to improve predictive accuracy and overall strategy performance.
